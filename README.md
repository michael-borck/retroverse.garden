## 🌱 Philosophy

- **Patience matters.**
- **Curiosity is rewarded.**
- **Not everything must be rushed or optimized.**
- **Some things are better *tended* than *engineered*.**

🌸 RetroVerse Gardens honors the spirit of gentle growth over time.

---
## ✨ Inspiration and Philosophy

RetroVerse Gardens is inspired by:

- 🌱 **The Zen Garden concept** — showcasing the beauty of CSS-driven design without altering the core HTML.
- 🌿 **Retro aesthetics** — CRT screens, pixel art, ASCII, simple retro visuals.
- 🌸 **The spirit of living worlds** — places where exploration is its own reward, not driven by SEO or profit.

The Gardens are built entirely with:

- **Vanilla HTML** — no frameworks
- **Vanilla CSS** — theming through pure stylesheets
- **Vanilla JavaScript** — lightweight interactivity, no dependencies

**The structure respects the cascading nature of CSS:**

- Every page loads:
  - 🌿 **Global `garden.css`** — shared across the entire site
  - 🌸 **Page-specific CSS** — for individual layouts (e.g., `hidden-grove.css`, `garden-journal.css`)
  - 🌈 **Theme CSS** — optionally loaded to create different moods (e.g., `crt.css`, `pixel.css`, `space.css`)

This strict separation ensures that:

- The HTML remains stable and portable
- The site is fully themeable and extensible
- Contributors can create new designs **without altering content**
- The spirit of Zen Garden — *content and design, gently separate but interwoven* — is honored
